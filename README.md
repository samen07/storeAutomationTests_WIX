# storeAutomationTests_WIX
Its simple demo of automation tests using Playwright+TS for Store

to run test go to next steps:
navigate to tests folder and init Playwright "npm init playwright@latest"
select TypeScript + end-to-end testing + install prefered browsers (if additional browsers not prompted, try "npx playwright install" and/or "npm install @playwright/test@latest")
to run test "npx playwright test"
no additional ReportTool configured but we still can use PlaywrightHTMLreport "npx playwright show-report"
